Firefly is a simple tool to transfer data between boxes.

And by simple I mean: This is a glorified (some may say unnecessarily overengineered) wrapper around rsync(1) over ssh(1).

Its main purpose is to reduce what needs to be explicitly typed because of the lack of path completion on the remote box. Apart from that there is some quality of life stuff here that should save some more time.

## Usage

```shell
firefly usage
```
provides a short help message.

For everything else RTFM.
